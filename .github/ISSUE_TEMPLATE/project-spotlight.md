<!-- 
Instructions:
Thanks for your application to join the .NET Foundation! 

1.  Here is a checklist of steps we’ll follow during the process: [https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/blob/master/new-projects.md](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/blob/master/new-projects.md)
2.  Please review the [Eligibility Criteria](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects#eligibility-criteria) before completing the application 
3.  Please fill out the application in the template below. If you prefer to submit via e-mail to keep information private, you can use this [application form](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/blob/master/OnBoardingQuestionaire.docx) and submit to contact@dotnetfoundation.org, referencing this issue number. You can also fill out the Word document and submit it as an [attachment to the issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests), via Google Doc, etc. If you have questions, fill out what you know and discuss on the issue.
4.  After review and comment by the advisory council, we will submit your questionnaire to the board of directors recommending we add your project.
5.  We will send you a contribution agreement via DocuSign and configure the CLA bot.
6.  Finally, we will send you a on-boarding checklist with a set of work items to perform to complete the process.


Some common questions that come up on the questionnaire:

**Project Transfer Signatories.**: List the top contributors, with __contact e-mail__. For most projects, this is the top 1-5 contributors who have contributed more than a few hundred lines of code.
**Contribution Model.**  Under the .NET Foundation contribution model, a project retains ownership of the project, but grants .NET Foundation a broad license to the project’s code and other intellectual property. The project also confirms that the project’s submissions to .NET Foundation are its own original work (there are also instructions for any third party materials that might be included).
**Project Trademarks - Licensed vs Disclaimed.** When signing the CLA you are asked to describe and choose how you want to handle any trademarks for the project.  These include the project name, at a minimum, and potentially any logos or other recognizable, non-descriptive titles used within the project – these do not need to be formally registered trademarks. 

By default, the .NET Foundation selects **Licensed** in the CLA

|Type|What it Means|Why you'd select it <img width=900/>|
-----|-------------|-------------------
|Licensed|Project retains ownership of any trademarks and licenses the .NET Foundation to use them.|This follows the same ownership/license structure as the copyright in the project. The project keeps ownership in the trademarks and .NET Foundation only has the rights that are specifically granted in the license. The project still retains the rights to enforce its rights in the trademarks. |
|Disclaimed|Project agrees not to enforce the trademark against the .NET Foundation or anyone else.|The project doesn’t claim any ownership rights to the trademarks and does not plan to control how .NET Foundation decides to use the trademarks. |
